# Super C++ Game
This game is based on Super Mario game idea, but focused on C++ treasure to create a running program between levels with this treasure.

# Planned Abilities
1. Cpp entity.
2. Cpp treasure boxes.
3. Cpp enemies: Rust, GO, JS, C, PHP...
4. Treasure boxes / destroying enemies can produce:
   1. C++ keywords:
      1. int, double, void
      2. class, struct, enum,...
      3. public, protected, private
      4. namespace
      5. inline
      6. using
      7. template, typename
      8. if, else, endif
      9. for
      10. new, delete
      11. ...
   2. Free writing sections to name variables, classes, namespaces, etc...
   3. C++ library features:
      1. std
      2. for_each, transform, accumulate, reduce
      3. vector, set, map, unordered_map, unordered_set, string, ...
      4. shared_ptr, unique_ptr
      5. ...
5. At the end of each level, the player will be able to use the collected treasure to write the program.
   1. The user can use operators without any limit:
      1. {}, [], ()
      4. ,
      5. ""
      6. ''
      7. +, -, *, /, ^, |, &, %, /, \\, <, >, !, =, #, :
      8. numbers: 0-9
      9. .
   2. The compiler path will be given at the beginning of the game, and can support any version of C++ standard.
   3. After compiling, there will be option to execute and getting the program result, with running limit of 10 seconds.
